# A Brief Introduction to Nuclear Terminology

Atoms are composed of a small, dense nucleus surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons. Applying an electric current through a gas like neon excites the electrons to higher energy levels within the neon atoms. However, this excited electron configuration is unstable and results in the electrons decaying back down to lower energy states, releasing photons in the form of visible light. A similar process can also occur inside atomic nuclei as well but at much higher energy scales. The nucleus of an atom is composed of individual nucleons, which come in two types: (1) positively charged protons and (2) electrically neutral neutrons. The most efficiency way to arrange the constituent nucleons within a given nucleus is the one which requires the least amount of energy, also known as the $\textit{ground state}$. Different configurations of those same nucleons require more energy, and the difference between the energy required to arrange nucelons in this higher energy state and the ground state is called the $\textit{excitation energy}$ $E_x$ of that nuclear level. The properties of these excited states provide insight into the structure of atomic nuclei.

A variety of different experimental methods are employed to populate the excited states of atomic nuclei, which are beyond the scope of this document. However, common observables from all these experiments are the high-energy photons, called gamma ($\gamma$) rays, that are emitted when energetically excited nuclei decay down to their ground state configuration. This is often a multi-step process, in which many $\gamma$-rays are emitted in rapid succession. These exicted state decays usually occur so quickly that even if the emitted $\gamma$ rays are detected, they will be observed to occur basically at the same time. A ubiquitous problem in nuclear physics is the analysis of large these large $\gamma$-ray datasets and the tedious reconstruction of these decay schemes without prior knowledge of the order in which these $\gamma$ decays occur. The goal of this research project is to use numerical optimization technqiues to recover the complete $\gamma$-ray decay scheme simply from the total number of observed $\gamma$-ray transitions at each unique energy and the number of times each of these $\gamma$ rays are observed "in coincidence," i.e. the the number of times two $\gamma$ rays of different energies are observed within the same time window.

## Level Schemes as Weighted, Directed Graphs

A $\textit{graph}$ is a mathematical concept used to represent a network of related objects. Each object has a corresponding $\textit{node}$ (or $\textit{vertex}$), and $\textit{edges}$ represent the relationships between nodes. It is useful to think of a $\gamma$ decay scheme as a weighted, directed graph, where the nodes correspond to the nuclear levels and the edges of the graph correspond to the $\gamma$ transitions between the levels. The edges are said to be "weighted" by the $\gamma$-ray $\textit{branching ratios}$, i.e. the probability of one excited state decaying to another nuclear level via $\gamma$ emission. The edges are also "directed" since more highly excited states can decay to less energetic nuclear levels but not the other way around. 

## Transition-Space and the Adjacency Matrix

Similarly, we can also represent nuclear decay sequences in "transition-centric" space. In this case, the observable $\gamma$-ray transitions are the nodes, while the exact meaning of the edges in this case is a bit more abstract. Ultimately, the existence of an edge connecting two nodes, implies that there must exist a nuclear level which is both populated by the $\gamma_i$ decay from a higher lying excited state and will decay via $\gamma_j$ emission. The weights of the edges correspond to the probability of $\gamma_j$ decay occurring immediately after $\gamma_i$ decay. The justification for representing $\gamma$ decay schemes in this unusual way is that weight of the edges connecting nodes $i$ and $j$ correspond to the elements of the $\textit{adjacency matrix}$ $A_{ij}$. The $A$ matrix has some useful mathematical properties and is ultimately the numerical solution to a system of equations that we are trying to solve subject to some physics constraints. Again, the details of these mathematics and finding the numerical solution for $A$ are beyond the scope of this sample code's documentation. The purpose of this code is calculate what $A$ should be from evaluated nuclear data, demonstrate that we can recover the level-centric decay scheme from the transition-centric $A$ matrix, and plot the graphical representation.

# The Code

Below is a brief description of the purpose and functionality of each of the files contained in this project. It also contains a walking through of an example Jupyter Notebook, which a user should reasonably be able to run on their local machine, assuming appropriate dependencies and programming environment compatibility.
